# Sudoku-Solver-using-backtracking
A simple sudoku solver using CPP. The code uses the concepts of recursion/backtracking with trial and error until it finally gets a solved grid satisfying all the conditions in sudoku. 

The code is designed for an interactive console and can be used to solve as many sudokus as the user requires. The user can also learn about the sudoku rules with the help of the about_sudoku() function. The program continues to take inputs until the user chooses the exit option. 

However, you may uncomment line 102 in the main function in case you wish to input all the values at once.

A sample testcase is uploaded in the files section for testing purposes. The code can be copied and run on any device with a g++ or c++ compiler installed.
